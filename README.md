# LANFileTransfer
An application for file transfer for any internet-browsing device to and from computers.

I often try to backup my iPhone photos and videos to my Window's laptop via USB, but these attempts are rarely successful (My laptop has bad USB ports).
I created this Flask Application as a solution to this problem.  While slower, the method is ultimately more reliable than the USB.  It is also compatible with any web-browsing device.

## Future improvements
- Progress bar for long downloads
- Prettier interface
- Creating an app with similar functionality on bluetooth?  This may be limited by the need to develop companion software for my phone.
